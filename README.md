### Track name

Generative AI

### Problem Statement :

To develop a Chrome extension that provides users with insights into YouTube videos by analyzing comments. The extension will classify comments into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, generate summarized remarks, and display essential keywords to help users decide whether a video is worth watching.

### Introduction :

Have you ever searched for a YouTube video seeking for a review or a full explanation of a topic, only to find after watching the entire video that it was not what you were looking for in the first place?

Previously, YouTube had a dislike button that helped you assess whether the video was useful or not, but the feature has been removed. However, there is a hack that can still help us determine whether the video is useful or not, and that is the comments.

Comments reflect a democratic / unbiased view of the video and also contains thorough analysis of the video, and thus are an ideal parameter for analyzing how good the video is.
